By: Carson, Howard, Girish, Sayna, Armaan, Ansh, Kowan

Our game is an text based adventure game. The user will get a chance to play as a character in ancient India. The player will join one of five provinces in the land and is presented with 3 main choices in the year before a great battle is taken place. Each province has a chance to make tactical decisions and choose to join the great battle at the end of the year.

There will be a limited amount of years before the game ends. If the player gets the chance to win all five provinces before the game ends, they win. Otherwise, the province with the most amount of land concurred will win the game.
